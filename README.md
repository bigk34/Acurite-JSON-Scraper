# Wunderground Station Forwarder

This code is built to be hosted on the free [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) platform. It takes in weather station data from:

- [Wunderground](https://wunderground.com/member/api-keys),
- [MyAcurite](https://myacurite.com/),
- [Davis WeatherLink](https://weatherlink.com/), or
- [WeatherFlow Tempest](https://tempestwx.com/)

and periodically sends it on to

- [Wunderground](https://wunderground.com/pws/overview),
- [Windy](https://stations.windy.com/),
- [PWSWeather](https://pwsweather.com/),
- [WeatherCloud](https://weathercloud.com/), and/or
- [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/stations).

## Setup

1. Create a new [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/) project and give it a name
2. Copy the code from [`code.gs`](https://github.com/leoherzog/WundergroundStationForwarder/releases/latest/download/code.gs) from [the latest release](https://github.com/leoherzog/WundergroundStationForwarder/releases/latest) in this repository to your new file
3. Configure the script for you

  - Choose your datasource:

    <details>
      <summary>Wunderground</summary>
